## How to run an ASR experiment with LibriSpeech
To train a full speech recognition system the pipeline is the following:
1. **Train a tokenizer.** The tokenizer takes in input the training transcripts and determines the subword units that will be used for both acoustic and language model training. **Training a tokenizer before the language and acoustic model is necessary**. Indeed, both of them will reuse this tokenizer to map the output tokens.
2. **Train a Language Model (LM).** The language model takes in input long texts from available books. We have recipes with RNN and transformer-based LMs. In both cases, the LM is used during beam search to assign different weights to different hypotheses generated by the acoustic model.
3. **Train an acoustic model (AM).** The acoustic model maps the input speech into a set of sub-words units. The current repository contains recipes for seq2seq (ctc+attention), transducers, and transformer-based systems. Since training an LM can take several days, by default the recipes downloads a pre-trained LM.

**The results obtained with the different models can be found in the corresponding sub-directories!**

**Note:** *This folder also contains a Grapheme-to-phoneme  (G2P) system that can be used to convert a sequence of characters into the corresponding sequence of phonemes.*

## How to simply use pretrained models to transcribe my audio file?

SpeechBrain provides a simple interface to transcribe audio files with pretrained models. All the necessary information can be found on the different HuggingFace repositories corresponding to our different models for LibriSpeech:
- [seq2seq (ctc+attention) + RNNLM](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech)
- [seq2seq (ctc+attention) + TransformerLM](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-crdnn-transformerlm-librispeech)
- [Transformer + ctc + TransformerLM](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech)
